Introduction
Towns were the core of any kingdom in medieval India. The emergence of big towns and
cities started in the eighth century. It was the time of many big emirates like Cholas,
Chalukyas and Pallavas. Each kingdom had many towns and they were classified according
to their purpose. Some were Administrative towns, it was the residing place of kings and
nobles and all the administrative activities were controlled from there. Other categories
were a commercial town, Port town, Temple town etc. Towns were generally fortified and
had a market in them. The rulers provided special protection to towns as they were one of
the sources of revenue for the kingdom. Sometimes towns had more than one function.
Thanjavur was an administrative centre for the Chola empire and it was also a pilgrimage
town, as it had famous temples and shrines inside the town.

and the Maldives. Vijayalaya had captured Thanjavur from Pallavas. The greatest rulers of
the Chola empire were Rajaraja Chola and Rajendra Chola.
Thanjavur became the capital of Cholas. Chola kings built many temples to
celebrate their victories. Some of the most famous temples were the Brihadishwara
temple and the Rajarajeshwar temple built by Rajaraja Chola. The Cholas had a
tradition of installing the image and statues of kings and queens inside the temple
campus.
The city of Thanjavur is situated on the banks of river Krishna and it became the
biggest pilgrimage site. People would come here to worship and they were
intoxicated by the marvellous architecture of the city.
Apart from the temple, the city had palaces with mandapas or platforms, from
where the king held the courts and issued orders. There were barracks for the
army stationed near the palace.
Another major feature of this town was the market. It was filled with traders selling
food grains like wheat and millet. Spices, Jewellery and Clothes were the major
items in the market.
Thanjavur played a crucial role in influencing the economy of nearby villages and
towns. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and Uraiyur produced fine cotton clothes
for the king and nobles and also for the public.
Weavers also produce clothes to make flags for ceremonies in the temple.
Sculptures from the nearby village Svamimalai were experts in making Bronz idols
and ornamental metal lamps. They produced multiple idols to sell in the market
and also for the temples in the city.

Temple Town and Pilgrimage Centre
Temple towns were towns, which were built around a specific temple. Such types of towns
were generally fortified and economic and social activities were related to temples.
Thanjavur is an immaculate example of a temple town. It is built around the Brihadeshwar
temple, which was built by Rajaraja Chola in the tenth century. The town of Thanjavur was
the capital of the Chola empire.
Kings built temples to celebrate their victories and to demonstrate their devotion to the
deities. The temples were given lands and grants. Temples were authorised to run their
administration and collect the taxes from their land to feed the pilgrims and carry out
rituals and celebrate festivals. Temples also received donations from the pilgrims and
nobles.
Temples used their collected wealth to finance the banking system and trade. The vast
income from temples was regulated by the temple committee. With the establishment of
the temple, the community of priests, artisans, labourers, businessmen and others resided
near the temple as they were dependent on the temple for their livelihood. They used to
cater for the pilgrims who came to the temple. Gradually the number of communities living
near the temple increased and a new town was formed.

There were many temple towns established in early medieval India, including Bhillasvamin
in Madhya Pradesh and Somnath in Gujrat. Other significant temple towns were
Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The pilgrimage
sites gradually converted into townships. Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu and Vrindavan in
Uttar Pradesh is the example of such townships. The temple town of Ajmer showed the
example of religious coexistence as it was the capital of Chauhan Kings in the 12th century
and later the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti settled there, which attracted many
devotees and became one of the most famous shrines in India.
